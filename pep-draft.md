Abstract
========

Installation of the python.org Python distribution on Windows is complex.
There are three main approaches with roughly equivalent levels of user
experience, and yet all of these suffer from different limitations, including
failing to satisfy modern usage scenarios. This PEP proposes a design for
a single install workflow tool that satisfies all the needs of the existing
installers, while avoiding most of their limitations, and provides the core
team with a long-term plan for releasing pre-built distributions.


Background
==========

-- what users want

-- what the MSI does

-- what the Store does

-- what uv/etc. do

Motivation
==========

[Clearly explain why the existing language specification is inadequate to address the problem that the PEP solves.]


Rationale
=========

[Describe why particular design decisions were made.]


Specification
=============

[Describe the syntax and semantics of any new language feature.]


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

[Describe potential impact and severity on pre-existing code.]


Security Implications
=====================

[How could a malicious user take advantage of this new feature?]


How to Teach This
=================

[How to teach users, new and experienced, how to apply the PEP to their work.]


Reference Implementation
========================

[Link to any existing implementation and details about its state, e.g. proof-of-concept.]


Rejected Ideas
==============

[Why certain ideas that were brought while discussing this PEP were not ultimately pursued.]


Open Issues
===========

[Any points that are still being decided/discussed.]


Footnotes
=========

[A collection of footnotes cited in the PEP, and a place to list non-inline hyperlink targets.]
